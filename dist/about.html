                <p>Hello, i am Ziyad but most people refer to me as Zi, for ease of pronounciation. At the time of this website i am studying F.6 at CCC Kwei Wah Shan college, i chose to take ICT as my elective subject and i used to have BAFS but BAFS wasnt my intrest so i had to drop that to focus on my main subjects such as Maths
                    i am passionate about learning Computer science, infact this Website was built by me from the scratch using Multiple Coding languages, HTML, SCSS, CSS and javascript!

                <h3>Coding(Full  Stack)</h3>
                <h6>1 year of Experince</h6>
                <p>i started to code in the late stages of COVID-19, nothing advance at the point i was only doing "print(hello, world)", as the Year went passed i gained more knowledge in this subject,
                    because of that i started to learn code on my own at my house starting with python working on simple algorithims and then moved on the Web design using CSS, HTML and Javascript!,
                    i used to ask my teacher alot of questions in the begining because of wanting to know more about Code.

                <h3>Health</h3>
                <h6>Weight Lifting</h6>
                <p>I am a big health advocate, i believe in order to keep the mind fresh the body must be healthy so i try my best to stay fit and go gym for weightlifting excersises to be in top physical condition
                    and prevent laziness, going to the gym has taught me dicipline and knowledge about how the humand body works and what it needs to perform at peak conditions.
